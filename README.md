Natal Infinity Scarf Astrology Knitting Program

Hello!
This is my program which takes an astrology chart and generates a knitting pattern from it. I'm working on improving the code and refining parts of the program. If you take a look, please let me know: astraknots@gmail.com or check out my website: www.astraknots.com

Currently it is written using Python version 3.5.2 and I've been developing it in PyCharm
