Natal Infinity Scarf Astrology Knitting Program

Hello!
This is my program which takes an astrology chart and generates a knitting pattern from it. I'm working on improving the code and refining parts of the program. If you take a look, please let me know: astraknots@gmail.com or check out my website: www.astraknots.com

Currently it is written using Python version 3.5.2 and I've been developing it in PyCharm

------ Update, 2023 ------
Have added a lot, now using a python venv. 
Previously a few packages installed (six, typing-extensions, wheel) that I'm not sure if I need.

Current venv is using Python 3.11
Packages installed that I am using: XlsxWriter, pypdf2
